# [How to Use Swift on Linux][published url]
## Instructor: [Derek Jensen][instructor url]


Swift is a new programming language from Apple, originally designed for creating iOS, OS X and watchOS apps. Swift is a compiled, type-safe language which draws from the best features of the new generation of languages, while also building on the success of C and Objective-C. Swift has a powerful type system for safe programming and adds many features to make the lives of programmers easier. Even though it's barely a year old, Swift is already popular with programmers for its flexibility and expressiveness.

And now, Apple has made Swift and its toolchain open source, allowing it to be used on non-Apple platforms! In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Derek Jensen will help you take open-source Swift for a test drive. You'll learn how to get up and running with Swift on Linux, natively or via a virtual machine, and you'll writing a simple cipher application for the Linux command line. All in under an hour! Is it possible? Absolutely. Let's get started.
